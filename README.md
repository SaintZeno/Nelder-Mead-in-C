Nelder-Mead-in-C
================

C program which finds the minimum of a function using the Neld Mead simplex algorithm 


Here's a description of the algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelderâ€“Mead_method   
or this link (which I like more than the wiki link)  http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/rchc/Teaching/GTPBootstrap/ExtraDetails/NelderMeadProof.pdf


I've devised a main, header, and associated implementation file. All must be linked for the main to work correctly.
